    	<p id="colorprocess">The Product backlog MUST be prioritized. The most important story should be in the top of the list, so the entire backlog is ranked in order based on story importance.</p>
    	<strong><li class="easysteps">Plan and Start your First Sprint</li></strong>
    	<p id="colorprocess">The team now picks items from the list, brainstorms and decides on what and how much they can complete in the upcoming sprint. This is called the <span id="colorscrum">sprint planning meeting.</span></p>
    	<strong><li class="easysteps">Close the Current and Start the Next Sprint</li></strong>
    	<p id="colorprocess">When the end of the time-box is reached all planned work should hopefully be done. If this is not the case it's up to the team to decide if the remaining work should transfer to the next sprint or be put back into the backlog.</p>
